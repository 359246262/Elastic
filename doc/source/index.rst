Welcome to Elastic's documentation!
===================================

Elastic is set of routines for calculation of elastic properties of 
crystalline materials. It is a third version of the in-house code I have 
written over last few years. 
The code was a basis for some of my publications [TiC]_ [ZrC]_ and was 
described briefly in these papers. The code was available to anyone 
and was used by some of my co-workers but was never properly published.

Recently, I have decided to re-implement it as a module for the 
`ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`_ system and publish it under the GPL.
Elastic is the fruit of this effort. The source code lives on the 
`launchpad project page <https://launchpad.net/elastic>`_ and the 
on-line documentation is placed on 
`Elastic website <http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/elastic/>`_.
