Welcome to Elastic's documentation!
===================================

Elastic is set of routines for calculation of elastic properties of 
crystalline materials. It is a third version of the in-house code I have 
written over last few years. 
The code was a basis for some of my publications [TiC]_ [ZrC]_ and was 
described briefly in these papers. The code was available to anyone, presented 
at our `Workshop on ab initio Calculations in Geosciences <http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/workshop/work2008/>`_ 
and used by some of my co-workers but was never properly published with
full documentation, project page etc. Nevertheless it is still available
to anyone as `Elastic 2 <http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/~jochym/elastic2/elastic2.tgz>`_.
I just do not recommend to use it without my help - which I am happy to provide.

Recently, I have decided to re-implement it as a module for the 
`ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`_ system and publish it properly under 
the GPL. Elastic is the fruit of this effort. The source code lives on the 
`launchpad project page <https://launchpad.net/elastic>`_ and the 
on-line documentation is placed on 
`Elastic website <http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/elastic/>`_.

The project is open and I welcome patches, ideas and other feedback.
