Introduction
============

Elastic is based on the standard elasticity theory (see [LL]_ for the detailed
introduction) and *finite deformation* approach to the calculation of elastic 
tensor of the crystal.

Physical Principles
-------------------

I have described basic physical principles on which the code rests in my 
habilitation thesis. Here I will include slightly edited second chapter of the 
thesis introducing the method and some implementation details.


Implementation
--------------

Elastic is implemented as an extension module to ASE system
