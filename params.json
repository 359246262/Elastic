{"name":"Elastic","tagline":"A module for ASE for elastic constants calculation.","body":"Elastic\r\n=======\r\n\r\nElastic is a set of python routines for calculation of elastic properties of \r\ncrystals (elastic constants, equation of state, sound velocities, etc.). \r\nIt is a third version of the in-house code I have \r\nwritten over few years and is implemented as a extension to the\r\n[ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) system.\r\nThe code was a basis for some of my publications and was \r\ndescribed briefly in these papers. The code was available to anyone, presented \r\nat the [Workshop on ab initio Calculations in Geosciences](http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/workshop/work2008/)\r\nand used by some of my co-workers. Nevertheless it was never properly published with\r\nfull documentation, project page etc. The old code is still available\r\nto anyone as [Elastic 2](http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/~jochym/elastic2/elastic2.tgz>).\r\nI just do not recommend to use it without my help - which I am happy to provide.\r\n\r\nRecently, thanks to generous support of:\r\n* Department of Computational Material Science, Institute of Nuclear Physics, PAN, Poland\r\n* Department of Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Canada, \r\n\r\nI was able re-implemented elastic as a module for the \r\nASE, integrate interface to the QuantumEspresso code and publish \r\nit properly as a PyPi package (elastic).\r\n\r\nThe on-line documentation is placed on [Elastic website](http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/elastic/)\r\nYou can obtain the \r\n[documentation as a PDF file](http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/~jochym/Elastic.pdf) \r\nas well.\r\n\r\nThe installation is simple (provided you have all the dependencies like \r\nscipy, numpy, ASE, pyspglib to name just a few):\r\n\r\n    pip install elastic\r\n\r\nIf you need a more elaborate \r\n[installation instruction](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/jochym/a7f552e8b1fced1bc996) \r\nfor computing environment to work with ASE - I have written just such a document.\r\nIt is a first in the series of tutorials of this subject and you can \r\nfind it under nbviewer link above.\r\n\r\nThe project is open and I welcome patches, ideas and other feedback. \r\n\r\nYou can also support the project and motivate me to work on it even more \r\nby donating using bitcoin address: 1Geq8khANDueVt1QdCS5GU2oNCtdc1uSMv .\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
