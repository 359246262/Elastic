<p>Elastic is a set of python routines for calculation of elastic properties of 
crystals (elastic constants, equation of state, sound velocities, etc.). 
It is a third version of the in-house code I have 
written over few years and is implemented as a extension to the
<a href="https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/">ASE</a> system.
The code was a basis for some of my publications and was 
described briefly in these papers. The code was available to anyone, presented 
at the <a href="http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/workshop/work2008/">Workshop on ab initio Calculations in Geosciences</a>
and used by some of my co-workers. Nevertheless it was never properly published with
full documentation, project page etc. The old code is still available
to anyone as <a href="http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/%7Ejochym/elastic2/elastic2.tgz">Elastic 2</a>.
I just do not recommend to use it without my help - which I am happy to provide.</p>

<p>Recently, thanks to generous support of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Department of Computational Material Science, Institute of Nuclear Physics, PAN, Poland</li>
<li>Department of Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Canada, </li>
</ul><p>I was able re-implemented elastic as a module for the 
ASE, integrate interface to the QuantumEspresso code and publish 
it properly as a PyPi package (elastic).</p>

<p>The on-line documentation is placed on <a href="http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/elastic/">Elastic website</a>
You can obtain the 
<a href="http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/%7Ejochym/Elastic.pdf">documentation as a PDF file</a> 
as well.</p>

<p>The installation is simple (provided you have all the dependencies like 
scipy, numpy, ASE, pyspglib to name just a few):</p>

<pre><code>pip install elastic
</code></pre>

<p>If you need a more elaborate 
<a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/jochym/a7f552e8b1fced1bc996">installation instruction</a> 
for computing environment to work with ASE - I have written just such a document.
It is a first in the series of tutorials of this subject and you can 
find it under nbviewer link above.</p>

<p>The project is open and I welcome patches, ideas and other feedback. </p>

<p>You can also support the project and motivate me to work on it even more 
by donating using bitcoin address: 1Geq8khANDueVt1QdCS5GU2oNCtdc1uSMv .</p>
